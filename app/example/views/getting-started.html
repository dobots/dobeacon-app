	DoBeacons from DoBots! </super-navbar-title> </super-navbar>

	<p>This application will allow you to configure so-called
		DoBeacons. These are like iBeacons, but can be plugged into a power
		outlet. This means no batteries are required, no maintenance, and
		improved localization through very short advertisement intervals.</p>

	<super-navigate view-id="using-the-scanner">
	<button
		class="button button-block button-positive icon-left super-wand">Scan
		for DoBeacons</button>
	</super-navigate>

	<p>To be able to configure a beacon we will need to scan
		for them first. The application will ask you to turn on Bluetooth Low Energy
		(BLE) for this. Note, that BLE is a totally different protocol from
		normal Bluetooth and does not drain your battery.</p>
